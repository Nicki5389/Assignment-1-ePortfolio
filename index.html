<h3><strong>Personal Information</strong></h3>
    <p> My name is Nicki Hulett. I’m 33 years old and first and foremost I am a mum to 4 beautiful young children (aged from 7 to 1 years old), a dog and 3 chickens. I am a Primary school teacher by trade. I graduated from Monash University in 2011 with a Bachelor of Education (Primary) and Bachelor of Arts (psychological studies) and have been teaching on and off in Victoria since. I have been at the one school since I was first employed and have taught both full-time and part-time to suit my family life. I was born in Australia and speak English. I follow the AFL and barrack for the mighty Collingwood Magpies.  </p>
<p>
Two interesting facts about me are; In 2019 I travelled for 12 months around Australia in a caravan with my family. It was the most amazing experience. Australia is such a beautiful and diverse country. The second interesting fact is that my biggest hobby is dog training. I absolutely love training dogs. My dog knows all sorts of party tricks, including being able to find a 50-cent coin anywhere in our backyard and being able to shut cupboard drawers on command. I actually wrote my own eBook on dog training, which I have since gone on to publish and sell online.

<h3><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h3>
<h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h5>
<p>Information technology (IT) is widely about computing and telecommunications. IT is about networking, hardware, software and the internet. IT in the 21st century seems to have infiltrated into all aspects of our lives and this has happened across the globe. I want to understand how it works. I want to be able to use it confidently and I want it to add positively to our lives. I want to have the knowledge to fix my own tech issues. I don’t want to have to rely on others for all my IT problems. IT is here to stay and I want to be a step ahead of the majority of the population. </p>
<p>
  My interest in IT started when I saw an article pop up on my Facebook page about the rising trend of IT jobs. This article confirmed the need for IT specialists now and in the future. The article also mentioned possible graduate pay scales and the potential for pay growth. I want a job where there is no limit on how much I can get paid, as there is with my current job as a teacher. I want to be able to further my skills and take on more responsibility and get paid accordingly. After further investigating, I'm drawn to the flexible nature of IT jobs as well. IT jobs allow individuals to work from anywhere in the world and at suitable times to them. According to a recent report, tech sector jobs are more likely to allow their employers to work from home and they are also more likely to provide technology that assists with this flexibility (TCA, 2022, p. 14).
</p>
<p>In regards to my IT experience, I am very limited. I have an iPhone which I mainly use for calls and to access my social media accounts, Facebook and Instagram or for internet banking to pay bills. I also have a computer that I use for basic computing needs, searching the internet, and creating documents in Word or PowerPoint. Other than that, I have different appliances at home that use some sort of technology, including my favourite, the robotic vacuum.  </p>
<h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
<p>RMIT has a great reputation for its IT degrees and courses. RMIT was also a university that offered online degrees through Open Universities Australia. I didn’t have the benefit of living in a capital city, so needed an online study method. I have always thought of RMIT as the technology university. RMIT offers a wide range of different degrees and specializations. Learning doesn’t just need to stop after an undergraduate degree. RMIT has great connections to the real world and this is very important for those wanting to enter the IT world and make it a career. I’m not sure if this is my path yet, but I want the options to be left open. Many experts in the field lecture or tutor at this university which means I get to learn from current IT specialists. RMIT also appears to offer a very practical learning experience, where students get to take a hands-on approach. There is also the benefit that RMIT offers a great student support service. Its connection to Smarthinking is a plus. This is a tutoring and writing help service. Finally, I like how RMIT has a global reputation for excellence in professional and vocational education. </p>
<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
<p>There is so much I want to learn during my studies. To be very specific, I want to learn how to use React Native to develop web-based applications. I had never heard of React Native till the webinar in Week 1. It is a program I would like to develop skills in.</p>
<p>Throughout this course in general, I want to learn about different IT systems and understand how certain IT systems work and cooperate together. I want to be able to fix all those technical issues that occur frequently. I would particularly love to learn how to develop and create software, applications and web pages. More simply, I want to discover what all these technical terms in the IT world mean. I want to be able to start speaking and understanding the language. Already I have started learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and repositories. All these words were foreign to me at the beginning of this course.  </p>

<p>Figure 1: Talent, 2022</P>
<h5>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you?</h5>
<p>This position, figure 1, is for a front-end developer to work on a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The system is called ‘LockedOn’ and is for use in the real estate industry, particularly helping real estate agents manage all aspects of their work. The position is looking for someone to help build a new and better mobile application, as well as improve and add on to their existing web-based platform. The role also looks for someone that can work independently, but in a collaborative environment.  </p>
<p>This position appeals to me because it sounds new and innovative. I am keen to develop both mobile and web-based apps or web pages. It allows for creativity, but also the use of new and exciting technology and features. I am also drawn to this position for its workplace flexibility. I have 4 children, so being able to work from home, at hours that suit, would be a big benefit to my life. </p>
<h5>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h5>
<p>The job advertisement clearly states that they are after a Senior Front-End Developer. This indicates that they want someone with experience in the industry. A vital skill that is required is extensive experience working with React Native and React for commercial applications. Other skills they are looking for are product and code management tools, including Jira and Github. The position also requires the ability to be open to learning new technologies such as ClojureScript and others.</p>
<h5>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h5>
<p>I am limited with the skills I currently have in the IT department at the moment. I am able to be a basic user of smartphones and laptops. I have used programs such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. I use different mobile applications for everyday uses, such as; ING or Westpac banking app, Google maps, Ecovacs app; to use my robotic vacuum, HotDoc app to book medical appointments and many more. </p>
<p>I also have a Bachelor of Education (Primary) and Bachelor of Arts (majoring in Psychological Studies) that was completed in 2011. I am a qualified primary school teacher and have 10 years of experience in the classroom. I have great teaching, planning and teamwork skills. I am an effective communicator and can communicate with people from all walks of life.</p>
<h5>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h5>
<p>To obtain the skills required for this position and other ones in the future, I believe that I should start with a Bachelor of Information Technology, Computer Science or Software Engineering. Throughout any of these degrees, I should focus on majoring in software development for mobile and web-based applications. A major part of this position is also having experience. Throughout completing my Bachelor and for the years after, I should focus on gaining experience in the area of mobile and web development in real-life experiences. </p>
<p>Specific skills I would need to learn and gain proficiency in, are; React Native/React, Jira, Github, ClojureScript, Html, CSS, JavaScript and I would also need to be aware of the new technologies coming in. I would need to learn all these skills. To do this, I would start by completing some short courses on these skills. I would then gradually increase my knowledge in all these areas and continue to look for more advanced skills and courses to attempt. With learning any of these skills, I would need to practice and continue practising. These are all skills that I would need to utilize frequently to ensure I gain proficiency in using them in a wide range of areas. I would also need to understand and gain confidence with cloud-based CRM systems.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h3>

<p>Figure 4: (Emtrain, n.d.)</p>
<h5>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
<p>I completed 3 online tests as required; The Myers-Briggs personality test, the Big 5 Personality test and the Learning Styles quiz. My results indicate several things. The Myers-Briggs personality test, figure 2, demonstrates that I am a ‘Defender’. I had a high score on the Introvert rating. These results also showed that I am more likely to be hard working. I found this test had a rather large classification of my result which was a bit confusing. Looking at the possible other profiles, I could also relate to different areas of them, which makes me question the validity of the test.  </p>
<p>Regarding the Learning Style test I completed, figure 3, the results indicated that I showed a disposition towards a Theorist and Pragmatist style of learning. This test suggests that I like to see the value of learning in the real world and experimenting. The test also suggests that I am disciplined and like to think through problems in a logical manner. However, I believe, that to some extent, you cycle through all four stages of the learning styles and methods as you grasp new concepts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Big 5 Personality test, figure 4, demonstrated that I am likely to be a conscientious student. That I am careful and diligent in the way I go about life and work. I think this test is very broad and the results are very basic and not very detailed.</p>
<p>I agree to some degree with parts of all these tests. My personality and learning styles are quite introverted and always have been. I am organized and like to know exactly how things are going to go. My work ethic is strong and I always ensure that I achieve my absolute best, whether that’s individually or as part of a team. These tests are good for the current moment, but do not take into account how our personalities or learning styles can change over time or in different situations. These tests are not completely accurate. I completed the tests twice and my results all changed slightly each time. These tests provide only a basis for learning style or personality style.</p>
<h5>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
<p>These results indicate the type of team member I would be, but the results are not absolute. I think my personality and learning style tests show that I could potentially be a quieter contributor to team meetings. However, when articulating my ideas, they would be of high quality and well thought out. My conscientious nature would ensure that the team operates effectively and in a positive manner and all work gets done on time and to a high standard. Anyone in the team would quickly learn, that I am super hard working and don’t let the team down in any way, despite my introverted personality. These results were personal to me and did not take into account other people separate from me. So basically, the results don't accurately demonstrate how I could be influenced by others in the team. </p>
<h5>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
<p>I believe teams work best when there is a variety of personality traits and learning styles involved. I also believe teams work best when there are clearly defined rules and a common goal. Although I have an introverted personality, I would hope to have an extroverted personality on my team. Both personalities do a great job of balancing each other out in most situations, although not always. I am hardworking and would expect others to also pull their weight. I think this should be taken into consideration when forming a team. I would work best with others that are also hard-working and willing to put in the effort. Motivation would be a key skill I would be looking for in others when deciding who to work with within a team. Everyone needs to take responsibility for their role in a team, all the work should be shared equally, but fairly.  </p>

<h3><strong>Project Idea</strong></h3>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>To develop a web-based application questionnaire that could also be used on iOS devices that addresses negative classroom behaviour by individual students. The questionnaire will consist of several multiple-choice and short answer questions that will assist any teacher in understanding why the student was behaving that way. Ideally, a short report could be downloaded that could also be sent home to parents. This is basically a data-gathering application, but in a style that many students are familiar with. According to an ACER article, almost all Australian students have access to a computer in their home (Thomson, 2015, p. 16)</p>
<h5>Motivation</h5>
<p>In today’s classrooms, behaviour management plays a large role. A report found that about 32% of students in Australia reported that their teacher has to wait a long time for students to quiet down at the beginning of language lessons (OECD, 2019). Teachers spend a large part of their day dealing with behavioural disruptions. I hope that this app takes a bit of the workload off teachers at particular moments. At times of misbehaviour, students could be directed to the app to complete the questionnaire, instead of staying put and continuing to disrupt the learning session or activity. I am a primary school teacher and I want something simple and easy for students to use. This app will allow individual students to complete the questionnaire independently.</p>
<p>
  A similar application currently on the market is ‘ClassDojo’. ClassDojo rewards users for positive behaviours and acknowledges when users do the wrong thing. The application aims to encourage users to do the right thing more of the time. Users are being reinforced by getting positive feedback in the form of online stickers. A study recently found that the ClassDojo application was an effective tool for increasing positive behaviours and decreasing negative behaviours in the classroom (Saeger, 2017). A limitation of this application is that it does not allow flexible user input about behaviour. The app seems to label positive or negative behaviour but does not seek to understand what is causing the behaviour or other factors contributing to negative behaviour. It does not allow students' voices but is great at tracking certain behaviours that reoccur frequently. The development of this current app would be great to be used in conjunction with an application like ClassDojo. However, the future app would allow users to get a bigger picture of the negative behaviour and hence could lead to teachers or caregivers developing better strategies to assist the child in times of need.
</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This is going to be a primarily web-based application with iOS capabilities. This application has the potential to be used in classrooms around the country. Classrooms have a variety of technology at hand, but not all have both iPads and laptops. I want to ensure that this application can be used on an iPad, if there is no other technology, for example, a laptop, available and vice versa. I want to develop this as a web-based application first because I believe it will be easier for students to use it on a laptop or computer where they have access to a standard keyboard which would be the recommended way. The product will be in the form of a questionnaire. The questionnaire is about the student’s feelings, beliefs and understandings about their negative behaviour. There will be some multiple-choice questions with pictures and simple words that require the user to identify how they are feeling. There will also be short answer questions where the user can type in the answer for questions like; “Why were you not following our school rules just now?” or “What should you be doing right now?” The app hopes to guide students to express their emotions, allow them to write out their thoughts and then start to point them in the right direction. </p>
<p>The application would have an inviting front page where users first come to. On this front page would be a button asking the user to start here. The user would then be able to click or press on the button and the questionnaire would start. The first page that then appears would have some questions and text boxes for information about the user, such as name, age and teacher email address. The next page would appear with one question on it and 4 multiple choice answers. The multiple-choice answers would either be in a single word or simple sentence format or small pictures of faces showing different emotions. The user would have to click on the answer that most applies to them at the time. Once clicked on, that would then click through to the next page and the next question. The first 3 questions would all be about the user picking emotions to go with how they are feeling or how they thought the other students or teacher were feeling. </p>
<p>
  The next set of questions would be short answer questions. A question would come up on the page and then a blank type box below. The user would be able to type their text in the box. On this page, there would also be a submit or next button, so they could continue with the questionnaire after completing the answer. I would probably include 3 short answer questions and after the third question, at the bottom of the page, there would be a ‘submit to teacher’ button. After this button is clicked, a copy of the student’s answers is automatically sent to the teacher’s email address. Clicking the final button also heads onto one more page. The last page would have 3 icons that are links to certain activities on the web. The user could click on the icon and it would direct them to the activity. Activities would be mindfulness activities that help the students calm before they are ready to rejoin the classroom activities.
</p>
<p>Other features the app would include would be an audio button on every page. The user would be able to click on this button to hear the questions read out. A voice-to-text converter would also be helpful for the short answer replies.  </p>
<h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
<p>React Native will be used to develop this web-based application. React Native is a software framework that was created by Meta Platforms to develop applications for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Web and more. React Native will be used to develop the framework for this new web application being created.  </p>
<p>I would need to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined to develop the web application. Html would be used to get the content onto the page. CSS would allow the web application to look nice and have a great colour scheme and layout. JavaScript would be needed to add the interactive features. I would also use Atom as the text editor program.</p>
<p>Also essential for this project is a basic Windows laptop or iOS device. These would need to be connected to a strong internet connection, such as the NBN.</p>
<h5>Skills Required</h5>
<p>The most important skills required for this project would be my ability and confidence to use React Native and understand and use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, I have limited knowledge of any of these skills. It is something I would need to learn how to use. There are many youtube videos and clips on how to master these services. To get this application up and running I would first need to learn the necessary skills. I would find and take short crash courses in each of the skills above. I would also find other people with skills in these areas to help me or teach me these skills. The success of this project would depend on how well I and others in my team could use these skills to create the application. The application would need to be appealing to use and look at. I would also need to have a creative flair to make it appealing and usable.  </p>
<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>This application would be a very useful tool for teachers if successful. Teachers would gain an insider understanding of what may be causing certain behaviour in their classroom. This app also allows students to take a break from the session they were in to complete the questionnaire allowing the teacher to continue teaching without disruptions. Important discussions would need to be had afterwards by the student and teacher about their answers and hopefully from that, some possible solutions could be explored. The success of this project would also depend on getting this application into the teacher's hands. Teachers would need to be made aware that this app is available to them.</p>
